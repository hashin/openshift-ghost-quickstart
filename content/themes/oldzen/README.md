**Uno Zen** is a fork of [Uno for Ghost](https://github.com/daleanthony/Uno) that provides some features missing in the original theme:

* Improve CSS layout and use a main image for each post.
* Search support by [ghostHunter](https://github.com/i11ume/ghostHunter/).
* Estimate the time of reading a post by [readingTime.js](https://github.com/michael-lynch/reading-time).
* Added Progress bar with support for different themes by [pace](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/).
* Better development and production workflow with Grunt.

... and more and more features in the future. If you want to help visit TODO section.

## Installation

1) Download the last release tagged version.

2) Execute `npm install` and `bower install` for install the dependencies.

4) Create your favicons with [Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/).

4) For production exec `grunt production`. This minify and concat your code.
